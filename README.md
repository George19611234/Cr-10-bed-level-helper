# Cr-10-bed-level-helper
# Cr-10-level-helper 3 different scripts that will help you level your bed if you don't have an auto bed leveling addon.    *The names have a number in the beginning so that you know exactly which script to run since sometimes the screen(Cr-10) doesnt show all letters*   1.Level.CR-10 is for the 300x300 printer 2.Level.CR-10-S4 is for the 400x400 pinter 3.Level.CR-10-s5 is for the 500x500 printer  WHAT IT DOES.   It will move to each corner and zero the z axis on it for 30 seconds. When 10 seconds are left, it will beep to let you know.   Before returning to the home position it moves to the center to verify the leveling there.
